> Proverbs 10
> ³ The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casts away the substance of the wicked.
> ⁴ He becomes poor that deals with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
> ⁵ He that gathers in summer is a wise son: but he that sleeps in harvest is a son that causes shame.
> ⁶ Blessings are on the head of the just: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
